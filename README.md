# Portfolio

Build a Portfolio website that contains the following elements:
o Header & Navigation Menu
o Carousel
o Showcase items from the student’s portfolio
o Contact Details (with links to an external site such as LinkedIn or portfolio websites)
o Contact Form (with validations). The form does not need to send an email.
• The website must be responsive and works well on most popular desktop, tablet and mobile
devices.
• Must have valid HTML and CSS.
• Source code must be committed on a new GitHub repository before the announced
assignment date deadline. No further commits must be done after the specified deadline.
• The site must be accessible via a published URL (such as GitHub Pages, Digital Ocean or
other providers).
• Frontend component libraries such as Bootstrap or Material Design Lite may be used.
• The portfolio website must be a showcase of the student’s work over the past years. This
must include the work the student has built during their time at UOM but may also be
extended to include personal work as well.
• (Bonus) The submitted website is configured with a personal domain owned by the student.
